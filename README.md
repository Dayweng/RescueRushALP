Welcome to Rescue Rush! All assets & user saved files are in the asset file.

To modify the unlocked levels, go to assets/data/user/user-data.txt
    Then change the unlocked levels to 3 or whatever amount of levels you desire to unlock

    The map can be modified via assets/data/maps/level1-map.txt and the numbers can be modified to modify the path and the map

Thank you!
